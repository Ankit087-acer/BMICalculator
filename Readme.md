ðŸŒŸ BMI Calculator

ðŸ“Œ Description
A BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator is a tool used to assess whether an individual has a healthy body weight for a given height. It is commonly used to screen for potential weight problems that could lead to health issues like obesity, underweight, or related conditions.
Limitations:
While BMI is a quick and useful tool for general assessments, it doesn't take into account other important factors like muscle mass, bone structure, or distribution of fat. For example, an athlete with a lot of muscle may have a higher BMI but not have excess body fat.
Many BMI calculators are available online, and some health apps integrate BMI measurement as part of a broader health tracking tool.
